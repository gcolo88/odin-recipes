<h3>Yerba mate, also known as <em>"mate"</em>, is an herbal tea. 
    It's a traditional drink in Latin and South America.</h3>
    <p>It's made by steeping dried leaves from the yerba mate plant in hot water.</p>
    <p>Yerba mate can be served cold or hot.</p> <p>Like black or green tea, it has caffeine, which can make you feel more alert and focused.</p>
    <h2>Step by step:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat water to boiling point -between 70 and 80ÂºC- without letting it boil.</li>
        <li>Fill 3/4 of the gourd with yerba mate.</li>
        <li>Cover the mate cup with your hand, turn it upside down and shake it gently to mix the components.</li>
        <li> Lift the gourd slowly up to an inclination of about 45 degrees and pour a bit of warm water on the side that has less yerba, in order to moisten the bottom.</li>
        <li>Using this same inclination, introduce the bombilla against the internal wall, trying not to move it later.</li>
        <li>Add hot water slowly on the side of the bombilla, until you see foam on the surface.</li>
        <li>As the yerba absorbs the water, pour a little more until it reaches the top, and your mate is ready to be enjoyed!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The caffeine in yerba mate can cause side effects. These include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Upset stomach.</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping.</li>
        <li>Feeling nervous or restless.</li>
        <li>Fast heartbeat.</li>
        <li>Becoming a World Champion</li>
    </ul>
